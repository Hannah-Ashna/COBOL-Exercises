# COBOL Exercises
As part of my placement role I have had to learn several different Mainframe based languages these include: COBOL, JCL, DTB and REXX to name a few. As I progress through the tasks I have been given I'll be updating this repository to include my completed code/solutions for anyone else interested in learning the language.

I'll include properly formatted exercise specification documents in due time.
