# COBOL Exercises
As part of my placement role I have had to learn several different Mainframe based languages these include: COBOL, JCL, DTB and REXX to name a few. As I progress through the tasks I have been given I'll be updating this repository to include my completed code/solutions for anyone else interested in learning the language.

## Exercises:
The specficiation for each of the exercises can be found in this [document](https://github.com/Hannah-Ashna/COBOL-Exercises/blob/main/COBOL%20Exercises.pdf) while all my solutions for them can be found in either the [COBOL](https://github.com/Hannah-Ashna/COBOL-Exercises/tree/main/COBOL) or [DTB](https://github.com/Hannah-Ashna/COBOL-Exercises/tree/main/DTB) folders.
